# Scraper GG Tooling

## Overview

This repo contains a collection of tools to scrape and process data from different Esports data sources, currently with a primary focus on [start.gg](https://www.start.gg/). The planned tools are (which will likely grow in the future):

- A Daemon that will continuously run and maintain up to date data from multiple upstream data sources (eg. `start.gg`).
- Multiple libs for querying individual sites and parsing them into a common format.
- A CLI for interacting with the Daemon.
